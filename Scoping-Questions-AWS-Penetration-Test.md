# AWS Pentest Scoping Questions
What AWS specific scoping questions should you ask as a practitioner, or prepare for as a business/product owner when taking on an AWS penetration test?

Here is what I use to better understand an AWS environment Iâ€™ll be pentesting:

## General
What is the primary goal for penetration testing?

What are the main areas of focus for this penetration test?

What is the general business purpose for the infrastructure / environment / application?

Has penetration testing been performed previously?

## Accounts
What is the AWS Account ID in scope - ############ 12 digits, and provide any AWS Account Aliases (if applicable)

Are AWS Organizations in use, and if so, provide the Management Account ID, and all other Account IDs in scope.

For each AWS Account in scope, provide a brief description and any useful information about the account.

## Services
What AWS services are in use?

Are there any specific AWS services you are particularly concerned about?

For each service, describe their purpose/use and connection within the environment.

	Example: DynamoDB is used for application user PII and data storage. Cognito is used for front-end user authentication. Lambda is used to handle user API requests and processing.

Can you provide a high-level overview of your AWS architecture, including mention of any applicable VPCs, subnets, and key services used?

Please provide the latest architecture diagrams of your environment.

In instances where no diagrams are provided, a built in workload discovery tool, or a third party a tool like cloudmapper can be used:

https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudmapper

https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/

## Quantifying Size
What is your approximate total monthly spend on AWS?

What are the approximate number of accounts, ec2 instances, databases, lambda functions, user accounts, etc.

## Sensitive Data
Where is sensitive data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stored within the environment?

What encryption methods are used for data at rest and in transit?

If your AWS environment were compromised, which service would you be most concerned about?

What are the key objectives, level of access or privileges, or end goal that should be targeted with testing?

What would be a worst case scenario / keeps you up at night in terms of an AWS environment breach?

What are the key assets or services you are most concerned about protecting?

## Access
Are any services publicly accessible? 

Which services should we be able to see from an unauthenticated external perspective?

What services are publicly accessible but safeguarded behind authentication mechanisms?

What authentication methods are used for accessing AWS services what does a typical auth flow look like? 

Are there any third party services used for authentication federation, i.e. Google, Microsoft, Okta, etc.

## Applications
Is AWS supporting an Application or service that should fall under the scope of this testing?

Please provide any API docs, API flows, Swagger, etc if applicable.

Walk me through the typical user flows (for each permission level) of the application and describe how the app is built off of underlying AWS services.

## Users
Who is a typical user of the infrastructure / environment / application?

Who is a typical user accessing the AWS console?

How do dev users typically access the infrastructure / environment / application?

What are the typical roles provisioned within this environment, and what is the approximate breakdown of the number of users per role.

Are there any IAM users or roles with elevated privileges that we should be aware of?

# Out of Scope
List any assets or accounts within the AWS environment that are explicitly out of scope

Are any of the services, data, or assets within the environment off limits for testing?

Are there any specific testing techniques or tools that should not be used?

## Additional Info
What other information would be useful for me to know when testing your AWS environment?

Does your environment have any AWS native or 3rd party cloud monitoring/security solutions implemented? 

Are there any other third party integrations?

Is there any AWS monitoring or alerting teams/personnel that I should be aware of, or who should be notified before testing?

Are there any WAF (Web Application Firewall) or Shield configurations in place for DDoS protection?

What logging and monitoring solutions are implemented (e.g., CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty)?

What security tools and services are implemented in your AWS environment to enhance security monitoring, incident response, and compliance, and how are they configured and used (e.g., Security Hub, AWS Config, Inspector, etc)?
